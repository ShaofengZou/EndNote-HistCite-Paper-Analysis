For the imaging of multiple-receiver synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) under the nonstop-hop-stop case, an exact analytical solution for the two-dimensional (2-D) frequency spectrum is usually difficult to obtain because of the existence of the double-square-root (DSR) term in the range history equation. Several approximate solutions for the 2-D spectrum have been derived to focus the multiple-receiver SAS data. In this paper, the range history geometry for multiple-receiver SAS is newly constructed to meet the demand of the derivation of an analytical 2-D spectrum. According to the geometry-based bistatic formula (GBF) method, a quasi-analytical 2-D spectrum with an unknown variable named half quasi-bistatic angle (HQBA) is reviewed. Based on the method of series reversion (MSR), the fourth order equation with respect to the HQBA is solved and an analytical HQBA is obtained. After substituting the analytical HQBA into the quasi-analytical 2-D spectrum, a completely analytical 2-D spectrum is obtained and the problem of the 2-D spectrum derivation caused by the DSR term is solved successfully. In this paper, an extended range Doppler (RD) algorithm based on the derived 2-D spectrum is proposed for focusing the multiple-receiver SAS data under the non stop-hop-stop case. The results of simulation and real experiment data imaging have validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.
