Real-time 3-D acoustical imaging technique is a key advance to broaden the scope and enhance the feasibility of underwater missions. In this paper, a real-time 3-D underwater acoustical imaging system to handle the actual tasks under a narrowband excitation is presented. The system consists of three parts: a transmitter, a receiving hydrophone array, and a signal processor. In this system, a distributed and parallel subarray (DPS) beamforming algorithm is proposed to process the acquired signals from a scene placed in the far field. The DPS beamforming algorithm is an approximate method for the sonar signal processing with an advantageous computational efficiency. The direct method (DM) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) beamforming are compared with DPS beamforming for the memory and computational requirements. Based on this algorithm, a prototype was developed, which has been extensively employed in the lake and sea trials. The trials demonstrate that the system can achieve the 3-D imaging of the scene and meet the real-time requirement of the underwater operations.
